My solutions to Advent of Code 2021! All in the name of learning Python by doing the low-level, straight-forward problems that form the basis of understanding a language.

To run any particular day, run up a terminal in the root folder and run:  
`python <day>.py`  
where `<day>` is whichever day's solution takes your fancy! Note that most solutions won't be optimal, or demonstrate the most concise way of solving the challenge. As the days go on I'm hoping this will improve, eventually to the point where a full Python program is easy to write.
